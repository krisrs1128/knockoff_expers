\title{Notes on Knockoffs for the Microbiome}
\author{Kris Sankaran}

\begin{document}

Motivation: microbiome species abundance vs. sample characteristics

- has become common to use modeling to study joint abundances -> characteristics
- often also do multiple testing, to quantify uncertainty
- knockoffs are an approach to unify these perspectives

Context
- Originally derived for standard lasso model (relatively recently)
- FDR control idea has been around for a few decades though
- Recently a few different extensions have cropped up: new settings,
assumptions, interpretations


\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Standard knockoffs
- setup notation and definitions
- define procedure
- state theorems for FDR control

Model-free knockoffs
- state describe changes in setup
- define changes in procedure (SCIP and Gaussian example)
- state associated theorem
